# WordleðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

An italian version of https://powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/

Basically it just replaces two list of words in original javascript.

Current status is minimal changes to have this work with Italian words, many improvements can be surely made (including further translation, better word selection/sources, ...).

Italian words taken from https://github.com/napolux/paroleitaliane

Run `nim r itLines` and replace two lines in wordle-it.js to regenerate.
